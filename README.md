# ❤️ Heart Disease Classification with Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project builds an **end-to-end classification model** to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical and demographic data. It demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow — from **data exploration** and **feature engineering** to **model training, evaluation, and visualization**.  

The project provides insights into how machine learning can support **healthcare decision-making** by identifying patients at higher risk of cardiovascular disease.

📊 Methods & Workflow
Data Exploration & Preprocessing:

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling

Modeling:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Random Forest

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Model Evaluation:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

ROC-AUC Curve

Confusion Matrix

📈 Results
The best-performing model achieved high classification accuracy while maintaining a good balance between precision and recall.

Feature importance analysis revealed key predictors of heart disease (e.g., age, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure).

Visualizations include confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature distributions.
